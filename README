Net::SNMP::Interfaces.  README Mon Nov 27 08:21:38 GMT 2000

This module is intended to provide simple methods of obtaining
network interface information from a host via SNMP.

PREREQUISITES
=============

The module requires Net::SNMP which must be installed before trying to
install the current module. 

INSTALLATION
============

After unpacking the distribution files you should change you current 
directory to the one which contains this file and you should run :


       perl Makefile.PL
       make
       make test
       make install

If 'make install' complains about not having permission to do something
then you will either have to become a user with the correct rights or
install the module somewhere you do have permission - see the section on
keeping your own private module library elsewhere in the Perl Documentation.

SUPPORT
=======

Please e-mail any bug reports or feature requests  to
<bug-Net-SNMP-Interfaces@rt.cpan.org> to the author Jonathan Stowe
<jns@gellyfish.co.uk>.

The code is hosted on Github at https://github.com/jonathanstowe/Net-SNMP-Interfaces
Please feel free to fork and suggest patches.  Especially welcome would be 
increased support for newer versions of SNMP (which weren't around when I first
made this.)
