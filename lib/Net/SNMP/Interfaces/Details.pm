=head1 NAME

Net::SNMP::Interfaces::Details - Object methods to obtain interface data.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $in_octets = $interface->ifInOctets();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents an individual interface as discovered by
Net::SNMP::Interfaces.  Although it is possible to call the contructor
directly it is primarily intended that these objects should be returned
by methods of Net::SNMP::Interfaces.

=head2 METHODS

=over

=item new HASH $args

The constructor for the class.  User code should probably never need to
call the constructor directly as Net::SNMP::Interface::Details objects
are returned by the Net::SNMP::Interfaces methods all_interfaces() and
interface().

There are three mandatory arguments:

=over

=item Session

A valid Net::SNMP object which will be used to make the requests for the
interface information.  This Net::SNMP object should currently only be 
of the blocking variety as no provision has been made for non-blocking
requests at present.

=item Index

The SNMP ifTable index for this interface.

=item Name

The name of this interface (e.g. 'eth0' ).

=back

The Name and Index arguments should have previously been obtained by
SNMP requests to the same host as the Session object has been created for.

=cut

sub new 
{
   my ( $proto, %args ) = @_;

   my $self = {};

   unless ( exists $args{Session} and ref($args{Session}) eq 'Net::SNMP')
   {
     croak "Session must be defined and be a Net::SNMP object";
   }

   $self->{_session} = $args{Session};
   $self->{_index}   = $args{Index};
   $self->{_name}    = $args{Name};

   return bless $self, $proto;
}

=item name

Returns the name of this interface.

=cut

sub name
{
  my ( $self ) = @_;

  return $self->{_name};
}

=item index

Returns the index of this interface.

=cut

sub index
{
  my ( $self ) = @_;

  return $self->{_index};
}

=item session

Returns the Net::SNMP session object that is being used to make requests
for this interface.  This probably is not needed but is here for
completeness' sake.

=cut

sub session
{
  my ( $self ) = @_;

  return $self->{_session};
}

=item error

Returns the text of the last error returned from SNMP session - will only
be meaningful if the last method call returned undef to indicate that an
error had occurred.

=cut

sub error
{
   my ($self) = @_;
   return $self->{_lasterror} || $self->session()->error();
}

=item IANAifType

Converts from an IANAifType integer value as will be returned by ifType
to its text equivalent.

=cut

sub IANAifType
{
   my ( $self, $iftype ) = @_;

   if ( defined $iftype )
   {
     return exists $IANAifType{$iftype} ? $IANAifType{$iftype} : 'other';
   }
   else
   {
     return $IANAifType{$self->ifType()} || 'other';
   }
}

=for pod

=back

The remainder of the methods are named after the literal names for the
SNMP entries for network interfaces.  The following descriptions are
taken from the IF-MIB with some additional comment from the author where
necessary.  If an error occurs in the SNMP session these methods will
return undef and the text of the error message can be determined by calling
the error() method.

=over

=item ifIndex

A unique value, greater than zero, for each interface.  It is
recommended that values are assigned contiguously starting from 1.
The value for each interface sub-layer must remain constant at least
from one re-initialization of the entity's network management system to
the next re-initialization.


=item ifDescr

A textual string containing information about the interface.  This string
should include the name of the manufacturer, the product name and the
version of the interface hardware/software.

(In practice this will be name of the interface e.g. 'eth0')

=item ifType

The type of interface.  Additional values for ifType are assigned by the
Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), through updating the syntax
of the IANAifType textual convention.


=item ifMtu

The size of the largest packet which can be sent/received on the
interface, specified in octets.  For interfaces that are used for
transmitting network datagrams, this is the size of the largest network
datagram that can be sent on the interface.


=item ifSpeed

An estimate of the interface's current bandwidth in bits per second.
For interfaces which do not vary in bandwidth or for those where
no accurate estimation can be made, this object should contain the
nominal bandwidth.  If the bandwidth of the interface is greater than the
maximum value reportable by this object then this object should report
its maximum value (4,294,967,295) and ifHighSpeed must be used to report
the interace's speed.  For a sub-layer which has no concept of bandwidth,
this object should be zero.


=item ifPhysAddress

The interface's address at its protocol sub-layer.  For example,
for an 802.x interface, this object normally contains a MAC address.
The interface's media-specific MIB must define the bit and byte ordering
and the format of the value of this object.  For interfaces which do not
have such an address (e.g., a serial line), this object should contain
an octet string of zero length.


=item ifAdminStatus

The desired state of the interface.  The testing(3) state indicates that
no operational packets can be passed.  When a managed system initializes,
all interfaces start with ifAdminStatus in the down(2) state.  As a result
of either explicit management action or per configuration information
retained by the managed system, ifAdminStatus is then changed to either
the up(1) or testing(3) states (or remains in the down(2) state).


=item ifOperStatus

The current operational state of the interface.  The testing(3) state
indicates that no operational packets can be passed.  If ifAdminStatus
is down(2) then ifOperStatus should be down(2).  If ifAdminStatus
is changed to up(1) then ifOperStatus should change to up(1) if the
interface is ready to transmit and receive network traffic; it should
change to dormant(5) if the interface is waiting for external actions
(such as a serial line waiting for an incoming connection); it should
remain in the down(2) state if and only if there is a fault that prevents
it from going to the up(1) state; it should remain in the notPresent(6)
state if the interface has missing (typically, hardware) components.


=item ifLastChange

The value of sysUpTime at the time the interface entered its current
operational state.  If the current state was entered prior to the last
re-initialization of the local network management subsystem, then this
object contains a zero value.


=item ifInOctets

The total number of octets received on the interface, including framing
characters.  Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur
at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as
indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.


=item ifInUcastPkts

The number of packets, delivered by this sub-layer to a higher
(sub-)layer, which were not addressed to a multicast or broadcast address
at this sub-layer.  Discontinuities in the value of this counter can
occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times
as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.


=item ifInNUcastPkts

The number of packets, delivered by this sub-layer to a higher
(sub-)layer, which were addressed to a multicast or broadcast address
at this sub-layer.  Discontinuities in the value of this counter can
occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times
as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.  This object
is deprecated in favour of ifInMulticastPkts and ifInBroadcastPkts.


=item ifInDiscards

The number of inbound packets which were chosen to be discarded even
though no errors had been detected to prevent their being deliverable
to a higher-layer protocol.  One possible reason for discarding such a
packet could be to free up buffer space.  Discontinuities in the value of
this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and
at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.


=item ifInErrors

For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of inbound packets that
contained errors preventing them from being deliverable to a higher-layer
protocol.  For character-oriented or fixed-length interfaces, the number
of inbound transmission units that contained errors preventing them
from being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol.  Discontinuities
in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the
management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of
ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.


=item ifInUnknownProtos

For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of packets received via
the interface which were discarded because of an unknown or unsupported
protocol.  For character-oriented or fixed-length interfaces that support
protocol multiplexing the number of transmission units received via
the interface which were discarded because of an unknown or unsupported
protocol.  For any interface that does not support protocol multiplexing,
this counter will always be 0.  Discontinuities in the value of this
counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at
other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.


=item ifOutOctets

The total number of octets transmitted out of the interface, including
framing characters.  Discontinuities in the value of this counter can
occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times
as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.


=item ifOutUcastPkts

The total number of packets that higher-level protocols requested be
transmitted, and which were not addressed to a multicast or broadcast
address at this sub-layer, including those that were discarded or
not sent.  Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur
at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as
indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.


=item ifOutNUcastPkts

The total number of packets that higher-level protocols requested be
transmitted, and which were addressed to a multicast or broadcast
address at this sub-layer, including those that were discarded or
not sent.  Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur
at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as
indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.  This object is
deprecated in favour of ifOutMulticastPkts and ifOutBroadcastPkts.


=item ifOutDiscards

The number of outbound packets which were chosen to be discarded even
though no errors had been detected to prevent their being transmitted.
One possible reason for discarding such a packet could be to free up
buffer space.  Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur
at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as
indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.


=item ifOutErrors

For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of outbound packets that
could not be transmitted because of errors.  For character-oriented
or fixed-length interfaces, the number of outbound transmission units
that could not be transmitted because of errors.  Discontinuities
in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the
management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of
ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.


=item ifOutQLen

The length of the output packet queue (in packets). This object has been
deprecated as of rfc2863.


=item ifSpecific

A reference to MIB definitions specific to the particular media being used
to realize the interface.  It is recommended that this value point to an
instance of a MIB object in the media-specific MIB, i.e., that this object
have the semantics associated with the InstancePointer textual convention
defined in RFC 1903.  In fact, it is recommended that the media- specific
MIB specify what value ifSpecific should/can take for values of ifType.
If no MIB definitions specific to the particular media are available,
the value should be set to the OBJECT IDENTIFIER { 0 0 }.

=back

These next methods are from the ifXTable as described in
rfc2863:

      This table contains objects that have been added to the Interface
      MIB as a result of the Interface Evolution effort, or replacements
      for objects of the original (MIB-II) ifTable that were deprecated
      because the semantics of said objects have significantly changed.
      This table also contains objects that were previously in the
      ifExtnsTable.

These methods may not be available from all network elements and
in those cases they will return undef.

=item ifName

The textual name of the interface.  The value of this object should be
the name of the interface as assigned by the local device and should
be suitable for use in commands entered at the device's `console'.
This might be a text name, such as `le0' or a simple port number,
such as `1', depending on the interface naming syntax of the device.
If several entries in the ifTable together represent a single interface
as named by the device, then each will have the same value of ifName.
Note that for an agent which responds to SNMP queries concerning an
interface on some other (proxied) device, then the value of ifName for
such an interface is the proxied device's local name for it.  If there
is no local name, or this object is otherwise not applicable, then this
object contains a zero-length string.

=item ifInMulticastPkts

The number of packets, delivered by this sub-layer to a higher
(sub-)layer, which were addressed to a multicast address at this
sub-layer.  For a MAC layer protocol, this includes both Group and
Functional addresses.  Discontinuities in the value of this counter can
occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times
as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.


=item ifInBroadcastPkts

The number of packets, delivered by this sub-layer to a higher
(sub-)layer, which were addressed to a broadcast address at this
sub-layer.  Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur
at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as
indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.


=item ifOutMulticastPkts

The total number of packets that higher-level protocols requested
be transmitted, and which were addressed to a multicast address at
this sub-layer, including those that were discarded or not sent.
For a MAC layer protocol, this includes both Group and Functional
addresses.  Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur
at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as
indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.


=item ifOutBroadcastPkts

The total number of packets that higher-level protocols requested
be transmitted, and which were addressed to a broadcast address
at this sub-layer, including those that were discarded or not
sent.  Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at
re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as
indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.


=item ifHCInOctets

The total number of octets received on the interface, including
framing characters.  This object is a 64-bit version of ifInOctets.
Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at
re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as
indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.


=item ifHCInUcastPkts

The number of packets, delivered by this sub-layer to a higher
(sub-)layer, which were not addressed to a multicast or broadcast
address at this sub-layer.  This object is a 64-bit version of
ifInUcastPkts.  Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur
at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as
indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.


=item ifHCInMulticastPkts

The number of packets, delivered by this sub-layer to a higher
(sub-)layer, which were addressed to a multicast address at this
sub-layer.  For a MAC layer protocol, this includes both Group
and Functional addresses.  This object is a 64-bit version of
ifInMulticastPkts.  Discontinuities in the value of this counter can
occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times
as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.


=item ifHCInBroadcastPkts

The number of packets, delivered by this sub-layer to a higher
(sub-)layer, which were addressed to a broadcast address at this
sub-layer.  This object is a 64-bit version of ifInBroadcastPkts.
Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at
re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as
indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.


=item ifHCOutOctets

The total number of octets transmitted out of the interface,
including framing characters.  This object is a 64-bit version of
ifOutOctets.  Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur
at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as
indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.


=item ifHCOutUcastPkts

The total number of packets that higher-level protocols requested be
transmitted, and which were not addressed to a multicast or broadcast
address at this sub-layer, including those that were discarded or not
sent.  This object is a 64-bit version of ifOutUcastPkts.  Discontinuities
in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the
management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of
ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.


=item ifHCOutMulticastPkts

The total number of packets that higher-level protocols requested be
transmitted, and which were addressed to a multicast address at this
sub-layer, including those that were discarded or not sent.  For a
MAC layer protocol, this includes both Group and Functional addresses.
This object is a 64-bit version of ifOutMulticastPkts.  Discontinuities
in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the
management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of
ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.


=item ifHCOutBroadcastPkts

The total number of packets that higher-level protocols requested
be transmitted, and which were addressed to a broadcast address
at this sub-layer, including those that were discarded or not sent.
This object is a 64-bit version of ifOutBroadcastPkts.  Discontinuities
in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the
management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of
ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.


=item ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable

Indicates whether linkUp/linkDown traps should be generated for this
interface.  By default, this object should have the value enabled(1)
for interfaces which do not operate on 'top' of any other interface
(as defined in the ifStackTable), and disabled(2) otherwise.


=item ifHighSpeed

An estimate of the interface's current bandwidth in units of 1,000,000
bits per second.  If this object reports a value of `n' then the
speed of the interface is somewhere in the range of `n-500,000' to
`n+499,999'.  For interfaces which do not vary in bandwidth or for those
where no accurate estimation can be made, this object should contain the
nominal bandwidth.  For a sub-layer which has no concept of bandwidth,
this object should be zero.


=item ifPromiscuousMode

This object has a value of false(2) if this interface only accepts
packets/frames that are addressed to this station.  This object
has a value of true(1) when the station accepts all packets/frames
transmitted on the media.  The value true(1) is only legal on certain
types of media.  If legal, setting this object to a value of true(1) may
require the interface to be reset before becoming effective.  The value
of ifPromiscuousMode does not affect the reception of broadcast and
multicast packets/frames by the interface.

=item ifConnectorPresent

This object has the value 'true(1)' if the interface sublayer has a
physical connector and the value 'false(2)' otherwise.

=item ifAlias

This object is an 'alias' name for the interface as specified by a network
manager, and provides a non-volatile 'handle' for the interface.  On the
first instantiation of an interface, the value of ifAlias associated with
that interface is the zero-length string.  As and when a value is written
into an instance of ifAlias through a network management set operation,
then the agent must retain the supplied value in the ifAlias instance
associated with the same interface for as long as that interface remains
instantiated, including across all re- initializations/reboots of the
network management system, including those which result in a change of
the interface's ifIndex value.  An example of the value which a network
manager might store in this object for a WAN interface is the (Telco's)
circuit number/identifier of the interface.  Some agents may support
write-access only for interfaces having particular values of ifType.
An agent which supports write access to this object is required to keep
the value in non-volatile storage, but it may limit the length of new
values depending on how much storage is already occupied by the current
values for other interfaces.

=item ifCounterDiscontinuityTime

The value of sysUpTime on the most recent occasion at which any one or
more of this interface's counters suffered a discontinuity.  The relevant
counters are the specific instances associated with this interface of
any Counter32 or Counter64 object contained in the ifTable or ifXTable.
If no such discontinuities have occurred since the last re- initialization
of the local management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
